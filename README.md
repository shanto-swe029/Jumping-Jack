# Jumping-Jack

**_Jumping Jack_** is an action game where the character, **Jack the Koala**, jumps around a level collecting as many coins as possible; he must reach the goal flag before time runs out.

Collecting timer objects gives the koala more time to explore. 

Some of the surfaces in the game are **jump-through platforms**, which behave like solid objects except that the koala can jump up through them from below and land on top, or **fall down** through the platforms from above. 

There are also **springboard objects**, which launch the koala high into the sky if he lands on them from above. 

Finally, there are **lock blocks**, which may come in many colors and are impassable until the koala collects the key of the same color.
